Advanced Angular Review Exercise 2 
==================================
Continue with the 'review' project. We need to ask the user for 'city' and 'country' values, then fetch a weather report from 

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=sofia,bg&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
(Replace sofia, bg with ${city) and ${country} as entered by the user)

From the returned JSON we will show description and temperature (in Celcius)
	e.g. myWeatherClassInstance.weatherDescription = this.weatherReport.weather[0].description

Write the http call in a service which is invoked when the user clicks a button 
When the app first loads, make a request using sensible defaults

Optional
--------
Offer the choice to show temperature in Kelvin (via a conversion service)
Show a few more weather data members, such as wind-speed and direction
Offer type-ahead (autocomplete) for the country field, including a debounce time
For example, suggest bg, gb, fr, de, ei, es, it, usa, uae, aus, ru (from a local data set)
Every time a weather report is requested, add the city/country combination to an array, along with a time-stamp and the resulting weather description
In a separate routed component, show these historical data members
Clicking one of these should make a fresh request using the city/country values
Persist the most recent city/country values in localStorage and retrieve them when the page first loads
