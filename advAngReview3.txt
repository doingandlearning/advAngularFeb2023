Advanced Angular Review 3
=========================
Re-use as much code as possible to build a project that uses the SWAPI service
	https://swapi.co/api/
Configure a service to accept a category and a number
	https://swapi.co/api/people/1     (or starships, species, planets etc.)
Configure a form to accept inputs for category and a number, then pass these to the service

You could do this by putting the generic reuseable form and the service into a library

Generate component(s) to show some of the returned data 
NOTE: the returned data is different for each catergory, but they all have a 'name' property

Generate a production build of this application

Optional
--------
Generate tanslations by marking up parts of your app and running i18n on it
Devise tests for your code (components and services)
Mark some fields for i18n and generate translation files
When a request is returned, immediately make a further requests for the related films
(handle multiple streams with a suitable rxjs operator)
